Assessment repository for Nexthink 

## Getting Started
The assestment consist of two diffrent tasks:
* The DataHandler solution is a simple .NET framework app with two simple projects, a libreary and a console UI.
* The Selfhealing task is a simple PowerShell script.
* A separate .EXE application is provided to simulate TOURISTINFO process proposed by the assesment.
* Please remember to set the project DataHandlerConsoleUI as a startup project, I have already done it but sometimes I found that this setting is missing.
